Introduction
-------------

libh2o is a lightweight (and supposedly fast) library for obtaining
water & steam properties. It provides a simple implementation of all
equations provided in IAPWS_ releases (IF97 and supplementary releases).

The library was intended to be fast, small and portable. Thus, it
doesn't depend on any additional libraries except the standard C
library, and doesn't use anything but straight functions specified
in IF97. Thus, it has all its limitations and accuracies.

API documentation
------------------

The API is shortly described in the installed header files.

The suggested API for library use is the one specified in ``h2o/h2o.h``.
Other header files are intended for low-level use and provide direct
access to the implemented equations and helper functions.

For linking to the library, the *libh2o* pkg-config package should be
used.

A simple use example::

	#include <stdio.h> /* for printf() */

	#include <h2o/h2o.h>

	int main()
	{
		h2o_t water;

		water = h2o_new_pT(10, 773.15); /* [MPa, K] */

		if (!h2o_is_valid(water))
		{
			fprintf(stderr, "Invalid parameters.\n");
			return 1;
		}

		printf("h = %f\n", h2o_get_h(water));

		return 0;
	}
